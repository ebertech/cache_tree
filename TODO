Need to change into a jQuery plugin.
Support multiple roots


Actually, don't do this:
Do some URL rewriting on the root. So if there's a special attr set then get the path of the data-src, and append it to the refresher URL. IE

<div data-base-src="http://localhost/cache_tree/">
	<data data-id="something" data-src="http://somewhere.com/foo/bar"/>
</div>

When #something gets invalidated it will call out to 

http://localhost/cache_tree/foo/bar

Too much logic being put into the cache tree. Whatever is caching should provide the right URL to call back if needed.
